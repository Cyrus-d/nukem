# Nukem

There are plenty of Chrome extensions that allow you to remove
elements from the page, but they all seem to be temporary. This
one remembers whats been removed, and removes it whenever the
page is loaded again.

Wildcards can be used to make it work on multiple pages from
the same site (for example) and an optional delay can be set in
case the element you want to remove doesn't get displayed right
away.
